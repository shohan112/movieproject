OMDb API : The Open Movie Database
The OMDb API is a RESTful web service to obtain movie information, all content and images on the site are contributed and maintained by OMDb users.

Movie Search App
This is a simple movie search app built using Vanilla JavaScript and the OMDb API. With this app, you can search for movies by title and get information such as the release year, plot summary, and ratings.

Getting Started
To get started with this project, you’ll need to have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You’ll also need to obtain an API key from the OMDb website.

Once you have your API key, you can clone this repository and open the index.html file in your browser to see the app in action.

Using the App
Using the app is simple. Just enter the title of the movie you want to search for in the search bar and hit enter. The app will then display information about the movie, including its poster, release year, plot summary, and ratings.
